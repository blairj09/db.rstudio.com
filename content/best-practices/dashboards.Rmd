## Design principles

There are two main principles to keep in mind when developing an enterprise level dashboard:

- **Push as much of the calculations of the dashboard back to the database** - The time it takes for a dashboard to load, and respond, will quickly become the most important aspect of its design.  It may be acceptable for a model to run for minutes or hours, but for dashboards, the expected time frame are a few seconds.  

- **Give the end-user with "train of thought" paths** -  These paths are commonly provided by way of a drill down or drill through from within the dashboard.  These paths allows the end-user to quickly answer questions that are currently on their mind.

## The code

A working example of the dashboard that will be used as the base of this article is available on GitHub. The project repository contains the code and all the supporting files:

- Visit the repository: https://github.com/sol-eng/db-dashboard

- Download a zipped file with all of the files from the repository: https://github.com/sol-eng/db-dashboard/archive/master.zip


## Use `shinydashboard`

The [shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/) package has three important advantages:

  1. **Provides an out-of-the-box framework to create dashboards in Shiny.**  This saves a lot of time, because the developer does not have to create the dashboard features manually using "base" Shiny.
  
  2. **Has a dashboard-firendly tag structure.** This allows the developer to get started quickly. Inside the `dashboardPage()`tag, the `dashboardHeader()`, `dashboardSidebar()` and `dashboardBody()` can be added to easily lay out a new dashboard.
  
  3. **It is mobile-ready.** Without any additional code, the dashboard layout will adapt to a smaller screen automatically.
  
Another option for creating dashboard with R is [flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/).  It will support all but one of the features discussed in this article: dynamic tabs, which are the basis of the techinque used in the example to drive the drill throughs. 

### Quick example

If you are new to `shinydashboard`, please feel free to copy and paste the following code to see a very simple dashboard in your environment:

```r
library(shinydashboard)
library(shiny)
ui <- dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(title = "Quick Example"),
  dashboardSidebar(textInput("text", "Text")),
  dashboardBody(
    valueBox(100, "Basic example"),
    tableOutput("mtcars")
  )
)
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$mtcars <- renderTable(head(mtcars))
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

## Connection strings and credentials

Even though is not addressed until after a first version needs to be publised, securing the credentials that the app will use to access the database is a very important step. 

In a lot of cases, the app is developed against one database, and run in production against a differente database.  This can present a challange if the connection string is "hard coded".

This site provides a couple of articles to help with addressing credentials and portability of code:

- [Securing Deployed Content](/best-practices/deployment/)
- [Making Scripts Portable](/best-practices/portable-code/)



In the example for this article, the [config](/best-practices/portable-code/#deploying-with-the-config-package) package will be used to help us manage the deployment of the app.  This code snippet is an example YAML file that `config` is able to read. It has one driver name for local development, and a different name for use during deployment:

```
default:
  mssql:
      Driver: "SQL Server"
      Server: "[server's path]"
      Database: "[database name]"
      UID: "[user id]"
      PWD: "[pasword]"
      Port: 1433
rsconnect:
  mssql:
      Driver: "SQLServer"
      Server: "[server's path]"
      Database: "[database name]"
      UID: "[user id]"
      PWD: "[pasword]"
      Port: 1433
```

The `default` setting will be automatically used when development, and RStudio Connect will use the `rsconnect` values when executing this code:

```r
dw <- config::get("mssql")
con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
                      Driver = dw$Driver,
                      Server = dw$Server,
                      UID    = dw$UID,
                      PWD    = dw$PWD,
                      Port   = dw$Port,
                      Database = dw$Database)
```


## Populate Shiny inputs using `purrr`

It a is very common preference for the values displayed in a user input, such as list or drop down, to be "human readable", and that the value of the selection be a unique identifier so that dependent queries return the correct information.

This section examines two cases and ways to format the list of options to be "shiny-friendly". 

### Drop down populated from database

Ideally, a look up table is available in the database so that the query is simple to execute. 

To separate the keys from the values, the `map()` function in the `purrr` package can be used.  In the example below, all of the records in the airlines table are collected, and a list of names is created, `map()` is then used to insert the carrier codes into each name node.

```r
airline_list <- tbl(con, "airlines") %>%
  collect  %>%
  split(.$name) %>%    # Field that will be used for the labels
  map(~.$carrier)      # Field that will be used for keys
```

The `selectInput()` drop-down menu is able to read the resulting `airline_list` list variable.

```r
  dashboardSidebar(
    selectInput(
      inputId = "airline",
      label = "Airline:",
      choices = airline_list,
      selected = "DL",
      selectize = FALSE
    )
```

### List populated from a vector

There are times when the possible values are static and small enough so that they fit in a vector.

A common example is the month name.  Tables typically store the month number, which is what needs to be used as a filter for all the queries in the dashboard.  The values that are ideally displayed to the user are the names of the months.  

For that, a newer function called `set_names()` can be used to add the caption that will be displayed in the input in a way that is "Shiny friendly"

```r
month_list <- as.list(1:12) %>%
  set_names(month.name)
  
month_list$`All Year` <- 99  
```
The `selectInput()` list menu is able to read the resulting `month_list` list variable.

```r
  selectInput(
    inputId = "month",
    label = "Month:",
    choices = month_list,
    selected = 99,
    size = 13,
    selectize = FALSE
  )
```


## Take advantage of `dplyr`'s "laziness"


Dashboards normally have a common data theme, which is sourced with a common data set.  A base query can be built because `dplyr` translates into SQL under the covers and, due to "laziness", doesn't evaluate the query until something is requested from it.  

```r
db_flights <- tbl(con, "flights") %>%
  left_join(tbl(con, "airlines"), by = "carrier") %>%
  rename(airline = name) %>%
  left_join(tbl(con, "airports"), by = c("origin" = "faa")) %>%
  rename(origin_name = name) %>%
  select(-lat, -lon, -alt, -tz, -dst) %>%
  left_join(tbl(con, "airports"), by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>%
  rename(dest_name = name) 
```

The `dplyr` variable can then be used in more than one Shiny output. A second example is in the code used to build the `highcharter` plot below.

```r
output$total_flights <- renderValueBox({

  result <- db_flights %>%           # Use the db_flights variable
    filter(carrier == input$airline)
  if(input$month != 99) result <- filter(result, month == input$month)
  
  result <- result %>%
    tally %>%
    pull %>%                        # Use pull to get the total count as a vector
    as.integer()
  
  valueBox(value = prettyNum(result, big.mark = ","),
           subtitle = "Number of Flights")
})
```

## Drill down

The idea of a "drill-down" action is that the end user is able to see part or all of the data that makes up the aggregate result displayed in the dashboard.  A "drill-down" action has two parts:

- **A dashboard element that displays a result is clicked. **  The result is usually aggregate data.
- **A new screen is displayed with another report.** The new report could be another report showing a lower-level aggregation, or it could show a list of rows that make up the result.

### A dashboard element is clicked

The following is one way that capturing a click event is possible.  The idea is to display the top airport destinations for a given airline in a bar plot.  When a bar is clicked, the desired result is for the plot to activate a drill-down.  The `highcharter` package will be used in this example.

To capture a bar-click event in `highcharter`, a small JavaScript needs to be written.  The example below could be used in most cases, so you can copy and paste it as-is into your code.  The variable name and the input name (`bar_clicked`) would be the only two statements that would have to be changed to match your chart.

```r
 js_bar_clicked <- JS("function(event) {Shiny.onInputChange('bar_clicked', [event.point.category]);}")
```

The command above creates a new JavaScript inside R that makes it possible to track when a bar is clicked.  Here is a breakdown of the code:

- **JS** - Indicates that the following function is JavaScript
- **function(event)** - Creates a new function, and expect an `event` variable.  The event that Highchart will pass is when a bar is clicked on, so the `event` will contain information about that given bar.
- **Shiny.onInputChange** - Is the function that JavaScript will use to interact with Shiny
- **bar_clicked** - Is the name of a new Shiny input; its value will default to the next item
- **[event.point.category]** - Passes the **category** value of the **point** where the click was made

The next section will illustrate how to capture the change of the new `input$bar_clicked`, and perform the second part of the "drill down".

In the `renderHighchart()` output function, the variable that contains the JavaScript is passed as part of a list of events: `events = list(click = js_bar_clicked))`.  Because the event is inside the `hc_add_series()` that creates the bar plot, then such click-event is tied to when the bar is clicked.

```r
output$top_airports <- renderHighchart({
  # Reuse the dplyr db_flights variable as the base query
  result <- db_flights %>%
    filter(carrier == input$airline) 
  if(input$month != 99) result <- filter(result, month == input$month) 
  result <- result %>
    group_by(dest_name) %>%
    tally() %>%
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%                          
    collect %>%
    head(10)                                      
  highchart() %>%
    hc_add_series(
      data = result$n, 
      type = "bar",
      name = paste("No. of Flights"),
      events = list(click = js_bar_clicked)) %>%   # The JavaScript variable is called here
    hc_xAxis(
      categories = result$dest_name,               # Value in event.point.category
        tickmarkPlacement="on")})
```
### Using `appendTab()` to create the drill-down report

The plan is to display a new drill-down report every time the end user clicks on a bar.  To prevent pulling the same data unnecessarily, the code will be smart enough to simply switch the focus to an existing tab if the same bar has been clicked on before.  

The new, and really cool, `appendTab()` function is used to dynamically create a new Shiny tab with a **DataTable** that contains the first 100 rows of the selection.  A simple vector, called `tab_list`, is used to track all existing detail tabs. The `updateTabsetPanel()` function is used to switch to the newly or previously created tab.

The `observeEvent()` function is the one that "catches" the event executed by the JavaScript, because it monitors the `bar_clicked` Shiny input.  Comments are added to the code below to cover more aspects of how to use these features.

```r
tab_list <- NULL

observeEvent(input$bar_clicked,{  
       airport <- input$bar_clicked[1]              # Selects the first value sent in [event.point.category]
       tab_title <- paste(input$airline,            # tab_title is the tab's name and unique identifier
                          "-", airport ,            
                          if(input$month != 99)     
                            paste("-" , month.name[as.integer(input$month)]))
       
       if(tab_title %in% tab_list == FALSE){        # Checks to see if the title already exists
         details <- db_flights %>%                  # Reuses the db_flights dbplyr variable
           filter(dest_name == airport,             # Uses the [event.point.category] value for the filter
                  carrier == input$airline)         # Matches the current airline filter
         
         if(input$month != 99)                      # Matches the current month selection
            details <- filter(details, month == input$month) 
         details <- details %>%
           head(100) %>%                            # Select only the first 100 records
           collect()                                # Brings the 100 records into the R environment 
           
         appendTab(inputId = "tabs",                # Starts a new Shiny tab inside the tabsetPanel named "tabs"
                   tabPanel(
                     tab_title,                     # Sets the name & ID
                     DT::renderDataTable(details)   # Renders the DataTable with the 100 newly collected rows
                   ))
         tab_list <<- c(tab_list, tab_title)        # Adds the new tab to the list, important to use <<- 
         }
         
       # Switches over to a panel that matched the name in tab_title.  
       # Notice that this function sits outside the if statement because
       # it still needs to run to select a previously created tab
       updateTabsetPanel(session, "tabs", selected = tab_title)  
     })
```
  
### Remove all tabs using `removeTab()` and `purrr`

Creating new tabs dynamically can clutter the dashboard. So a simple `actionLink()` button can be added to the `dashboardSidebar()` in order to remove all tabs except the main dashboard tab.
  
```r
# This code runs in ui
  dashboardSidebar(
       actionLink("remove", "Remove detail tabs"))
```
The `observeEvent()` function is used once more to catch when the link is clicked.  The `walk()` command from `purrr` is then used to iterate through each tab title in the `tab_list` vector and proceeds to execute the Shiny `removeTab()` command for each name. After that, the tab list variable is reset.  Because of environment scoping, make sure to use double less than ( `<<-` ) when resetting the variable, so it knows to reset the variable defined outside of the `observeEvent()` function.

```r
# This code runs in server
  observeEvent(input$remove,{
    # Use purrr's walk command to cycle through each
    # panel tabs and remove them
    tab_list %>%
      walk(~removeTab("tabs", .x))
    tab_list <<- NULL
  })
  
```

## Conclusion

 This example uses Shinydashboard to create enterprise dashboards, but there are other technologies as well. Flexdashboard is a great way to build similar enterprise dashboards in R Markdown. We used SQL Server to populate this dashboard, but you can use any database. For more information on using databases with R, see http://db.rstudio.com/.
