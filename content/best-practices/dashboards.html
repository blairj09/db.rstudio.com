<h2>Design principles</h2>
<p>A few principles to keep in mind when developing an enterprise level dashboard:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Push as much of the calculations of the dashboard back to the database</strong> - The time it takes for a dashboard to load, and respond, will quickly become the most important aspect of its design. It may be acceptable for a model to run for minutes or hours, but for dashboards, the expected time frame are a few seconds.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Give the end-user with “train of thought” paths</strong> - These paths are commonly provided by way of a drill down or drill through from within the dashboard. These paths allows the end-user to quickly answer questions that are currently on their mind.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make data driven inputs</strong> - It is easy to “hard code” the values that will be available in an input, such as a drop down. This may become a problem later on if the possible values change over time. An ancillary principle is to always use a look up table to obtain the list of values, when available. It is not ideal to obtain a list of possible values by grouping and summarizing a large column.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure the database credentials</strong> - Most often, a service account is made available for reports and dashboards that have access to a database. In that case, it is important to know how to properly safeguard the credentials of the service account.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>The code</h2>
<p>A working example of the dashboard that will be used as the base of this article is available on GitHub. The project repository contains the code and all the supporting files:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Visit the repository: <a href="https://github.com/sol-eng/db-dashboard" class="uri">https://github.com/sol-eng/db-dashboard</a></p></li>
<li><p>Download a zipped file with all of the files from the repository: <a href="https://github.com/sol-eng/db-dashboard/archive/master.zip" class="uri">https://github.com/sol-eng/db-dashboard/archive/master.zip</a></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="use-shinydashboard" class="section level2">
<h2>Use <code>shinydashboard</code></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/">shinydashboard</a> package has three important advantages:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Provides an out-of-the-box framework to create dashboards in Shiny.</strong> This saves a lot of time, because the developer does not have to create the dashboard features manually using “base” Shiny.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Has a dashboard-firendly tag structure.</strong> This allows the developer to get started quickly. Inside the <code>dashboardPage()</code>tag, the <code>dashboardHeader()</code>, <code>dashboardSidebar()</code> and <code>dashboardBody()</code> can be added to easily lay out a new dashboard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It is mobile-ready.</strong> Without any additional code, the dashboard layout will adapt to a smaller screen automatically.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Another option for creating dashboard with R is <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/">flexdashboard</a>. It will support all but one of the features discussed in this article: dynamic tabs, which are the basis of the techinque used in the example to drive the drill throughs.</p>
<div id="quick-example" class="section level3">
<h3>Quick example</h3>
<p>If you are new to <code>shinydashboard</code>, please feel free to copy and paste the following code to see a very simple dashboard in your environment:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(shinydashboard)
library(shiny)
ui &lt;- dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(title = &quot;Quick Example&quot;),
  dashboardSidebar(textInput(&quot;text&quot;, &quot;Text&quot;)),
  dashboardBody(
    valueBox(100, &quot;Basic example&quot;),
    tableOutput(&quot;mtcars&quot;)
  )
)
server &lt;- function(input, output) {
  output$mtcars &lt;- renderTable(head(mtcars))
}
shinyApp(ui, server)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="connection-strings-and-credentials" class="section level2">
<h2>Connection strings and credentials</h2>
<p>Even though is not addressed until after a first version needs to be publised, securing the credentials that the app will use to access the database is a very important step.</p>
<p>In a lot of cases, the app is developed against one database, and run in production against a differente database. This can present a challange if the connection string is “hard coded”.</p>
<p>This site provides a couple of articles to help with addressing credentials and portability of code:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/best-practices/deployment/">Securing Deployed Content</a></li>
<li><a href="/best-practices/portable-code/">Making Scripts Portable</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the example for this article, the <a href="/best-practices/portable-code/#deploying-with-the-config-package">config</a> package will be used to help us manage the deployment of the app. This code snippet is an example YAML file that <code>config</code> is able to read. It has one driver name for local development, and a different name for use during deployment:</p>
<pre><code>default:
  mssql:
      Driver: &quot;SQL Server&quot;
      Server: &quot;[server&#39;s path]&quot;
      Database: &quot;[database name]&quot;
      UID: &quot;[user id]&quot;
      PWD: &quot;[pasword]&quot;
      Port: 1433
rsconnect:
  mssql:
      Driver: &quot;SQLServer&quot;
      Server: &quot;[server&#39;s path]&quot;
      Database: &quot;[database name]&quot;
      UID: &quot;[user id]&quot;
      PWD: &quot;[pasword]&quot;
      Port: 1433</code></pre>
<p>The <code>default</code> setting will be automatically used when development, and RStudio Connect will use the <code>rsconnect</code> values when executing this code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dw &lt;- config::get(&quot;mssql&quot;)
con &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
                      Driver = dw$Driver,
                      Server = dw$Server,
                      UID    = dw$UID,
                      PWD    = dw$PWD,
                      Port   = dw$Port,
                      Database = dw$Database)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="populate-shiny-inputs-using-purrr" class="section level2">
<h2>Populate Shiny inputs using <code>purrr</code></h2>
<p>It a is very common preference for the values displayed in a user input, such as list or drop down, to be “human readable”, and that the value of the selection be a unique identifier so that dependent queries return the correct information.</p>
<p>This section examines two cases and ways to format the list of options to be “shiny-friendly”.</p>
<div id="drop-down-populated-from-database" class="section level3">
<h3>Drop down populated from database</h3>
<p>Ideally, a look up table is available in the database so that the query is simple to execute.</p>
<p>To separate the keys from the values, the <code>map()</code> function in the <code>purrr</code> package can be used. In the example below, all of the records in the airlines table are collected, and a list of names is created, <code>map()</code> is then used to insert the carrier codes into each name node.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>airline_list &lt;- tbl(con, &quot;airlines&quot;) %&gt;%
  collect  %&gt;%
  split(.$name) %&gt;%    # Field that will be used for the labels
  map(~.$carrier)      # Field that will be used for keys</code></pre>
<p>The <code>selectInput()</code> drop-down menu is able to read the resulting <code>airline_list</code> list variable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>  dashboardSidebar(
    selectInput(
      inputId = &quot;airline&quot;,
      label = &quot;Airline:&quot;,
      choices = airline_list,
      selected = &quot;DL&quot;,
      selectize = FALSE
    )</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="list-populated-from-a-vector" class="section level3">
<h3>List populated from a vector</h3>
<p>There are times when the possible values are static and small enough so that they fit in a vector.</p>
<p>A common example is the month name. Tables typically store the month number, which is what needs to be used as a filter for all the queries in the dashboard. The values that are ideally displayed to the user are the names of the months.</p>
<p>For that, a newer function called <code>set_names()</code> can be used to add the caption that will be displayed in the input in a way that is “Shiny friendly”</p>
<pre class="r"><code>month_list &lt;- as.list(1:12) %&gt;%
  set_names(month.name)
  
month_list$`All Year` &lt;- 99  </code></pre>
<p>The <code>selectInput()</code> list menu is able to read the resulting <code>month_list</code> list variable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>  selectInput(
    inputId = &quot;month&quot;,
    label = &quot;Month:&quot;,
    choices = month_list,
    selected = 99,
    size = 13,
    selectize = FALSE
  )</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="create-a-base-query-using-dplyr" class="section level2">
<h2>Create a base query using <code>dplyr</code></h2>
<p>In most cases, all of the plots and tables in a dashboard share a common base query. For example, they will all show the same month’s data. Using <code>dplyr</code> to build the base query has the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplifies the code because it prevents the repetition of the same filters and joins</li>
<li><code>dplyr</code> “laziness” allows for the base query to be built with out it being executed until it is used to get the data for a given plot or table</li>
<li>Abstracts the translation of the SQL syntax. The dashboard will work with no, or minimal, changes if the database vendor changes.</li>
<li>The modular nature of this approach allows to just add a few simple, and easy to understand, <code>dplyr</code> steps to get the slice or aggregation of the data needed to be displayed on the plot or table.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the base query will more likely have to be assembled based on the current input selection, then a Shiny <code>reactive()</code> function is necessary to be used instead of a regular <code>function()</code>. This is because the <code>input$...</code> variables can only be evaluated inside a Shiny reactive function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>  base_flights &lt;- reactive({
    res &lt;- flights %&gt;%
      filter(carrier == input$airline) %&gt;%
      left_join(airlines, by = &quot;carrier&quot;) %&gt;%
      rename(airline = name) %&gt;%
      left_join(airports, by = c(&quot;origin&quot; = &quot;faa&quot;)) %&gt;%
      rename(origin_name = name) %&gt;%
      select(-lat, -lon, -alt, -tz, -dst) %&gt;%
      left_join(airports, by = c(&quot;dest&quot; = &quot;faa&quot;)) %&gt;%
      rename(dest_name = name)
    if (input$month != 99) res &lt;- filter(res, month == input$month)
    res
  })</code></pre>
<p>Then, the Shiny <code>output</code> function starts with the base query (<code>base_flights</code>), and finishing <code>dplyr</code> steps, in the form of verbs, are appended, and piped directly to the plotting or display function. It is important to note that before sending the resulting data set to Shiny, either a <code>collect()</code> or <code>pull()</code> function needs to be used.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>  output$per_day &lt;- renderValueBox({
    base_flights() %&gt;%      #------ Base query 
      group_by(day, month) %&gt;%  #-- Finishing steps   
      tally() %&gt;%                  
      summarise(avg = mean(n)) %&gt;%
      pull() %&gt;%
      round() %&gt;%
      prettyNum(big.mark = &quot;,&quot;) %&gt;% 
      valueBox(             # -- Pipe right into a Value Box
        subtitle = &quot;Average Flights per day&quot;,
        color = &quot;blue&quot;
      )
  })</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="using-r2d3-for-interactivity-and-drill-down" class="section level2">
<h2>Using <code>r2d3</code> for interactivity and drill-down</h2>
<p>The idea of a “drill-down” action is that the end user is able to see part or all of the data that makes up the aggregate result displayed where the end-user clicks on.</p>
<p>In a Shiny app or dashboard, there’s the R object that contains the plot or table needs a way to pass to Shiny the value what was that was clicked on. The best way to do this, is by using Shiny’s JavaScript inside a given plot. This activates a reactive function inside the app.</p>
<p>The use of the visualization packages called <a href="http://www.htmlwidgets.org/">htmlwidgets</a> is very common. This set of packages are wrappers on top of D3/JavaScript plots. There may be times when the available <code>htmlwidgets</code> package falls short, either by not integrating with Shiny, or by not providing the exact visualization that is needed for the dashboard.</p>
<p>This article, the package <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/index.html">r2d3</a> will be used. This package allows us to custom build D3 visualizations from the ground up, for maximum flexibility and best integration with Shiny. A more in-depth article on how to integrate Shiny with <code>r2d3</code> is available here: <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/articles/shiny.html">Using r2d3 with Shiny</a>.</p>
<div id="two-ready-to-use-r2d3-plots" class="section level3">
<h3>Two ready-to-use <code>r2d3</code> plots</h3>
<p>The example dashboard used in this article contains two D3 scripts that are “Shiny ready”. One is a column plot and the other a bar plot. They have been developed in a way that you can easily copy the entire script and use it in your own dashboard.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sol-eng/db-dashboard/blob/master/col_plot.js">col_plot.js</a> - Requires a <code>data.frame</code> or <code>tibble</code> with the following names and type of data:
<ul>
<li><code>x</code> - Expects the category’s value. For example, if it represents a month, then it would contain the month’s number.</li>
<li><code>y</code> - Expects the value of the height of the column.</li>
<li><code>label</code> - Expects the category’s caption. It is what will be displayed to the end-user. For example, if it represents a month, then it would contain the month’s name.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sol-eng/db-dashboard/blob/master/bar_plot.js">bar_plot.js</a> - - Requires a <code>data.frame</code> or <code>tibble</code> with the following names and type of data:
<ul>
<li><code>x</code> - Expects the value of the widht of the bar.</li>
<li><code>y</code> - Expects the category’s value. For example, if it represents a month, then it would contain the month’s number.</li>
<li><code>label</code> - Expects the category’s caption. It is what will be displayed to the end-user. For example, if it represents a month, then it would contain the month’s name.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to <code>r2d3</code>, the plots can easily be rendered. This code snippet shows how simple is to combine the technique of using a base query, and then pipe the finishing transformations directly into the <code>r2d3()</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>  output$top_airports &lt;- renderD3({
    # The following code runs inside the database
    base_flights() %&gt;%
      group_by(dest, dest_name) %&gt;%
      tally() %&gt;%
      collect() %&gt;%
      arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;%
      head(10) %&gt;%
      arrange(dest_name) %&gt;%
      mutate(dest_name = str_sub(dest_name, 1, 30)) %&gt;%
      rename(
        x = dest,              # Make sure to rename the 
        y = n,                 # variables to what the 
        label = dest_name      #  D3 script expects
      ) %&gt;%
      r2d3(&quot;bar_plot.js&quot;)
  })</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="handling-the-click-event-from-d3" class="section level3">
<h3>Handling the click event from D3</h3>
<p>The D3 plots provided in the GitHub repository already contain the necessary Shiny JS code to trigger a reactive function when clicked on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>col_plot.js</strong> - Creates a <code>input$col_clicked</code> inside the Shiny app.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>bar_plot.js</strong> - Creates a <code>input$bar_clicked</code> inside the Shiny app.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Inside the app, include an <code>observeEvent()</code> function that will capture the value returned by the D3 plot:</p>
<pre><code>  observeEvent(input$bar_clicked, {
  # ----- Function&#39;s code --------
  })</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="using-appendtab-to-create-the-drill-down-report" class="section level3">
<h3>Using <code>appendTab()</code> to create the drill-down report</h3>
<p>The plan is to display a new drill-down report every time the end user clicks on a bar. To prevent pulling the same data unnecessarily, the code will be smart enough to simply switch the focus to an existing tab if the same bar has been clicked on before.</p>
<p>The new, and really cool, <code>appendTab()</code> function is used to dynamically create a new Shiny tab with a <strong>DataTable</strong> that contains the first 100 rows of the selection. A simple vector, called <code>tab_list</code>, is used to track all existing detail tabs. The <code>updateTabsetPanel()</code> function is used to switch to the newly or previously created tab.</p>
<p>The <code>observeEvent()</code> function is the one that “catches” the event executed by the JavaScript, because it monitors the <code>bar_clicked</code> Shiny input. Comments are added to the code below to cover more aspects of how to use these features.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tab_list &lt;- NULL

                            paste(&quot;-&quot; , month.name[as.integer(input$month)]))
       
       if(tab_title %in% tab_list == FALSE){        # Checks to see if the title already exists
         details &lt;- db_flights %&gt;%                  # Reuses the db_flights dbplyr variable
           filter(dest_name == airport,             # Uses the [event.point.category] value for the filter

         }
         
       # Switches over to a panel that matched the name in tab_title.  
       # Notice that this function sits outside the if statement because
       # it still needs to run to select a previously created tab

     })</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="remove-all-tabs-using-removetab-and-purrr" class="section level3">
<h3>Remove all tabs using <code>removeTab()</code> and <code>purrr</code></h3>
<p>Creating new tabs dynamically can clutter the dashboard. So a simple <code>actionLink()</code> button can be added to the <code>dashboardSidebar()</code> in order to remove all tabs except the main dashboard tab.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># This code runs in ui
  dashboardSidebar(
       actionLink(&quot;remove&quot;, &quot;Remove detail tabs&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>The <code>observeEvent()</code> function is used once more to catch when the link is clicked. The <code>walk()</code> command from <code>purrr</code> is then used to iterate through each tab title in the <code>tab_list</code> vector and proceeds to execute the Shiny <code>removeTab()</code> command for each name. After that, the tab list variable is reset. Because of environment scoping, make sure to use double less than ( <code>&lt;&lt;-</code> ) when resetting the variable, so it knows to reset the variable defined outside of the <code>observeEvent()</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># This code runs in server
