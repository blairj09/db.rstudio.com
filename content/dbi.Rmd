The [DBI](http://rstats-db.github.io/DBI/) package provides an interface between R and databases; it separates the operations that run against the database from the functions that are exposed to the user and other applications.  By doing this, the same R commands can be used to perform the same operations over a variety of databases.

## When to Use

We recommend using [dplyr](/dplyr/) for day-to-day data preparation and tidying.   The [DBI](http://rstats-db.github.io/DBI/) package is a great tool to help with the rest of database-related tasks such as the following:

- Connecting to and disconnecting from a database
- Retrieving the list of tables and fields
- Adding or removing tables 
- Writing data back to a table
- Running recurring queries 
- Executing stored procedures (if supported)


The [DBI: R Database Interface](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DBI/vignettes/spec.html) provides a comprehensive review of how DBI works. 


```{r, include = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
library(odbc)
library(config)
library(DBI)

con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), 
  .connection_string = paste0("Driver={sqlserver};
                              Server=", config::get("datawarehouse")$server ,";
                              Port=1433;
                              Database=", config::get("datawarehouse")$database ,";
                              UID=", config::get("datawarehouse")$uid ,";
                              PWD=", config::get("datawarehouse")$pwd ,";"))

```

## Connecting to a Database

When using the Connections interface, The RStudio IDE generates an R code snippet that connects to the database (see [Connect to a Database](/connect/)).

The connection snippet uses DBI's `dbConnect()` command to open the connection.  This is the command where we specify the driver, user, password, database name, and other arguments needed to properly start a session with the database.  Conversely, `dbDisconnect()` will close the connection.

## Tables & Fields

If you are using the RStudio IDE, then exploring an open database connection is as easy as expanding and drilling down into the schema using the Connections tab. 

Using code, to get a list of the tables in an existing database connection, use `dbListTables()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dbListTables(con)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
dbListTables(con)[1:6]
```

For a list of the fields in a particular table inside the database connection use `dbListFields()`

```{r, echo = TRUE, cache = TRUE}
dbListFields(con, "flights")
```

## Adding and Removing Tables

The `dbWriteTable()` and `dbRemoveTable()` can be used to perform their respective operations.  The user will need to have the proper database rights to be able to run these operations.

A data frame can be passed to `dbWriteTable()` to create and simultaneously populate the table:

```{r, eval = FALSE , cache = TRUE}
library(nycflights13)
dbWriteTable(con, "flights", flights)
```


## Running a Query

The `dbGetQuery()` command allows us to write queries and retrieve the results. How to best use this command is examined in this article: [Run Queries Safely](/run-queries-safely/)
