```{r,eval=FALSE}

con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
                      Driver       = "[your driver's name]",
                      servername   = "[your server's path]",
                      database     = "[your database's name]",
                      UID          = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database user"),
                      PWD          = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database password"),
                      Port         = 5439)
