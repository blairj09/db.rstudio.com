## Driver Options

Please refer to the official page from Cloudera for instructions on how to download and setup the driver: [Impala ODBC Connector](https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/connectors/impala/odbc/2-5-39.html)

## Package Options

The **`odbc`** package, in combination with a driver, provides `DBI` support and an ODBC connection.

## Connection Settings

There are five settings needed to make a connection:

  - **Driver** - See the [Drivers](/drivers) section for setup information 
  - **Host** - A network path to the database server
  - **Schema** - The name of the schema
  - **UID** - The user's network ID or server local account
  - **PWD** - The account's password
  - **Port** - Should be set to **21050**

```{r,eval=FALSE}

con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
                      Driver = "[your driver's name]",
                      Host   = "[your server's path]",
                      Schema = "[your schema's name]",
                      UID    = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database user"),
                      PWD    = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database password"),
                      Port   = 21050)

```
