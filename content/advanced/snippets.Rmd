## Overview

Code snippets are text macros that are used for quickly inserting common
snippets of code. For example, the `fun` snippet inserts an R function definition:

![Snippet Completion](snippet-completion.png)

If you select the snippet from the completion list, it will be inserted along
with several text placeholders which you can fill in by typing and then pressing
**Tab** to advance to the next placeholder:

Other useful snippets include:

- `lib`, `req`, and `source` for the `library()`, `require()`, and `source()` functions,

- `df` and `mat` for defining data frames and matrices,

- `if`, `el`, and `ei` for conditional expressions,

- `apply`, `lapply`, `sapply`, etc. for the apply family of functions,

- `sc`, `sm`, and `sg` for defining S4 classes/methods.

Snippets are a great way to automate the insertion of commonly used code, and
are available for R, C/C++, JavaScript, and several other languages.

## Inserting Snippets

As illustrated above, code snippets show up alongside other code completion 
results and can be inserted by picking them from the completion list. By
default, the completion list will show up automatically when you pause typing
for 250 milliseconds and can also be manually activated via the **Tab** key. In
addition, if you have typed the character sequence for a snippet and want to
insert it immediately (without going through the completion list), you can press
**Shift+Tab**.

Note that for Markdown snippets within R Markdown documents, you always need to 
use the **Shift+Tab** sequence as there is no standard tab completion available 
within the Markdown editing mode.

## Customizing Snippets

You can edit the built-in snippet definitions and even add snippets of your own
via the **Edit Snippets** button in **Global Options -> Code**:

Custom snippets are defined using the `snippet` keyword. The contents of the 
snippet should be indented below using the **Tab** key (rather than with
spaces). Variables can be defined using the form `{1:varname}`. For example,
here’s the definition of the `setMethod()` snippet:

```
snippet sm
    setMethod("${1:gen}", ${2:"class"}, function(${3:obj}, ...) {
        ${0}
    })
```

Because `$` is used as a special character to denote where the cursor should
jump after completing each section of a snippet, in order to insert a literal
`$` it must be escaped as `\$`.

## Executing R Code

You can also run R code in your snippet. You can use &#96;r expr&#96; anywhere in
your snippet; your R code will be executed when the snippet is expanded, and the
result inserted into the document. For example, the following snippet can be
used to insert a timestamp based on the output of the R `date()` function:

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
cat(
  'snippet ts',
  '  `r paste("#", date(), "------------------------------\n',
  sep = "\n"
)
```

You can also, as of RStudio v0.99.706, pass the text following the cursor into a
snippet, using `$$`. For example, the following snippet could be used to evaluate
an expression following an `!` (note that this is not part of the default set of
RStudio snippets):

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
cat(
  'snippet !',
  '  `r eval(parse(text = "$$"))`',
  sep = "\n"
)
```

If you type `!rnorm(5)<Shift-Tab>`, you should see the output of running
`rnorm(5)` inserted into the editor. Be careful not to run code that could hang
or freeze your R session!

## Saving and Sharing Snippets

Once you’ve customized snippets for a given language, they are written into the
`~/.R/snippets` directory. For example, the customized versions of R and C/C++
snippets are written to:

```
~/.R/snippets/r.snippets
~/.R/snippets/c_cpp.snippets
```

You can edit these files directly to customize snippet definitions or you can 
use the `Edit Snippets` dialog as described above. If you need to move custom 
snippet definitions to another system, then simply place them in `~/.R/snippets`
and they’ll be used in preference to the built-in snippet definitions.
