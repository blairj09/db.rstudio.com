There are two options for connecting to a PostgreSQL database:

- Using the `odbc` package with a database driver
- Using the `RPostgres`  package

## Using the `odbc`pacakge

The **`odbc`** package, in combination with a driver, provides `DBI` support and an ODBC connection.

### Driver options

- **PostgreSQL** - The official PostgreSQL website provides instructions on how to download and setup their driver: [psqlODBC - PostgreSQL ODBC driver](https://odbc.postgresql.org/)

- **RStudio Professional Drivers** - RStudio Server Pro, RStudio Connect, or Shiny Server Pro users can download and use RStudio Professional Drivers at no additional charge. These drivers include an ODBC connector for PostgreSQL databases.  RStudio delivers standards-based, supported, professional ODBC drivers. Use RStudio Professional Drivers when you run R or Shiny with your production systems. See the [RStudio Professional Drivers](https://www.rstudio.com/products/drivers/) for more information. 

### Connection Settings

There are six settings needed to make a connection:

  - **Driver** - See the [Drivers](/drivers) section for setup information 
  - **Server** - A network path to the database server
  - **Database** - The name of the schema
  - **UID** - The user's network ID or server local account
  - **PWD** - The account's password
  - **Port** - Should be set to **5432**

```{r,eval=FALSE}

con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
                      Driver   = "[your driver's name]",
                      Server   = "[your server's path]",
                      Database = "[your database's name]",
                      UID      = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database user"),
                      PWD      = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database password")
                      Port     = 5432)

```

## Using `RPostgreSQL`

`RPostgreSQL` is an DBI-compliant interface to the PostgreSQL database.  The package acts as both the database driver and the DBI interface.

The code, and additional information, are also accessible via the [Google Code project page](https://code.google.com/archive/p/rpostgresql/).  The official CRAN page is here: [RPostgreSQL: R Interface to the 'PostgreSQL' Database System](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RPostgreSQL/)
