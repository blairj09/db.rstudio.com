<p>The <a href="https://github.com/gaborcsardi/keyring">keyring</a> package enables us to access the operating systemâ€™s credential store.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::install_github(&quot;gaborcsardi/keyring&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we will create a new key ring called <em>rstudio.odbc</em> and add a single key with the server path and credentials. Additional servers can be added to the same key ring by adding additional keys.</p>
<p>The way <strong>keyring</strong> retrieves data is by passing the Key Ring name and a <strong>service</strong> name. In this method, we will use the server path as the <strong>service</strong> so it will act as our key to retrieve user name and password to use for that particular server.</p>
<p>To prevent passing the server path in our code, we will use another package called <strong>config</strong>, which is discussed in the next section.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>keyring::keyring_create(&quot;rstudio.odbc&quot;)

keyring::key_set_with_value(service = &quot;sol-eng-sqlserv.cihykudhzbgw.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com&quot;, 
                            username = &quot;rstudioadmin&quot;, 
                            password = &quot;ABCd4321&quot;, 
                            keyring = &quot;rstudio.odbc&quot;)</code></pre>
