title: Simplify connections using the config package
weight: 8

The [config](https://github.com/rstudio/config) package simplifies management of environment specific configuration values.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("config")
```

The values are saved in a YAML file called **config.yml**.  The package also allows R code to be used as values, we will use this capability to retrieve the credentials from Key Ring.  

This is the YAML file used for this exercise:

```
  default:
    datawarehouse: 
      server: "sol-eng-sqlserv.cihykudhzbgw.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com"
      uid: !expr keyring::key_list("sol-eng-sqlserv.cihykudhzbgw.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com",  
           keyring = "rstudio.odbc")[1,2]
      pwd: !expr keyring::key_get("sol-eng-sqlserv.cihykudhzbgw.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com",  
           keyring = "rstudio.odbc")
      database: "airontime"
```
