  <p>At <strong>RStudio</strong>, we are working to make it as easy as possible to work with databases in R. This work focuses on three key areas:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>Developing best-in-class packages</strong> These packages include: <code>dplyr</code>, <code>odbc</code>, <code>keyring</code>, <code>pool</code> and others.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Integrating with RStudio</strong> Starting with version 1.1, RStudio helps you write the R code you need to connect to a database, remembers connections you’ve made, and allows you to explore the objects and data in your database.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Promoting best practices</strong> This website is the main way we provide support in this area. RStudio is also working through other delivery channels, like upcoming webinars and in-person training at <strong><a href="https://www.rstudio.com/conference/">rstudio::conf 2018</a></strong></p></li>
  </ul>

<p>The new RStudio <strong>Connections Pane</strong> makes it possible to easily connect to a variety of data sources, and explore the objects and data inside the connection.</p>
<p>The Connections Pane is currently available only in the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/">preview release of RStudio 1.1</a>. Be sure to use the latest version of the <a href="/odbc">odbc</a> package.</p>

<h2><strong>dplyr</strong> as a database interface</h2>
<p>The <code>dplyr</code> package simplifies data transformation. It provides a consistent set of functions, called verbs, that can be used in succession and interchangeably to gain understanding of the data iteratively.</p>
<p><code>dplyr</code> is able to <strong>interact with databases directly</strong> by translating the <code>dplyr</code> verbs into SQL queries. This convenient feature allows you to ‘speak’ directly with the database from R. Other advantages of this approach are:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="/homepage/interact.png"   align="right" height="200" width="350"></p>
</div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Run data exploration routines over all of the data</strong>, instead of importing part of the data into R.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use the SQL Engine to run the data transformations.</strong> In effect, computation is being pushed to the database.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collect into R only a targeted dataset.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>All of your code is in R.</strong> Because<code>dplyr</code> is used to communicate with the database, there is no need to alternate between languages or tools to perform the data exploration.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>Connect to a database</strong></h2>
<div>
<p><img src="/homepage/open-source.png" height="200" width="400" align="left"></p>
</div>
<p><strong>At the center of this approach is the <code>DBI</code> package.</strong> This package acts as <em>‘middle-ware’</em> between packages to allow connectivity with the database from the user or other packages. It provides a consistent set of functions regardless of the database type being accessed. The <code>dplyr</code> package depends on the <code>DBI</code> package for communication with databases.</p>
<p>There are packages that enables a direct connection between the an open-source database and R. Currently, such packages exist for the following databases: <em>MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, and bigquery</em>.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="/homepage/commercial.png" height="200" width="400" align="right"></p>
</div>
<p>Most commercial databases, like Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server, offer ODBC drivers that allow you to connect your tool to the database. Even though there are R packages that allow you to use ODBC drivers, the connection will most likely not be compatible with <code>DBI</code>. The new <code>odbc</code> package solves that problem by providing a <code>DBI</code> backend to any ODBC driver connection.</p>
<p>If you are interested in creating your own package that connects <code>DBI</code> to a database, please review the article <a href="backend">DBI Backend</a>.</p>

<h2>SQL Translations for <code>dplyr</code></h2>
<p>A complementary package called <code>dbplyr</code> contains the translations of the vendor-specific SQL for <code>dplyr</code> to use. As of today, we have translations for the following databases:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="/logos/mssql.png", width = 50, height = 50> <a href="microsoft-sql-server">Microsoft SQL Server</a></li>
<li><img src="/logos/oracle.png", width = 50, height = 50> <a href="oracle">Oracle</a></li>
<li><img src="/logos/hive.png", width = 50, height = 50> <a href="hive">Apache Hive</a></li>
<li><img src="/logos/impala.png", width = 50, height = 50> <a href="impala">Apache Impala</a></li>
<li><img src="/logos/postgresql.png", width = 50, height = 50> <a href="postgresql">PostgreSQL</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the development version of <code>dbplyr</code>, we also have translations for:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="/logos/redshift.png", width = 50, height = 50> <a href="redshift">Amazon Redshift</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Is the database you are interested in not listed here? You can still use <code>DBI</code> and <code>odbc</code> to connect and send SQL queries. If you would like to contribute a translation, please see the <a href="translation">SQL Translation</a> page in this website.</p>
